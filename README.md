# monoframe
A decent PHP framework.

Documentation [here](https://github.com/TheUnium/monoframe/tree/main/docs).

I have not idea how to properly publish this, because this was not meant to be public, i am just bored so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

I will probably make this a proper framework with higher quality of code, slowly and eventually... Till then, I don't recommend using this for serious projects.

## installation
- Go to releases, and download `Source code` and extract the zip into a folder.
- Install composer (If you don't have it for some reason).
- Run `$ composer init`
- You can change routes by going to `/routes/web.php`. Views are in `/resources/views/` and they must end in `.mono.php` 
(eg : `hello.mono.php`). Done :)
